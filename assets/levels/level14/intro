“Planet Dinloponia here, how can I help you?”

“Yes, I'm Feldstärke, the engineer sent by the interim government to fix your laser connection.”

“I see. Have you heard the news? The interim government was reformed today into our actual new government. We are now called the 'Republic of Freedom', isn't this great?”

“What? That was fast. How could they hold elections this quickly?”

“Well, they announced that there wouldn't be any elections for the first term, since the population and infrastructure are still in such disarray… The president was chosen by a smaller internal vote for now. In four years, after we have rebuilt and recovered from the civil war, we will hold our first elections in over one hundred years.”

“No elections? Well, I guess it's understandable under the circumstances.”

“Yes. Now, if you'd excuse me, we are about to celebrate.”

“Sure. I'll just do my job.”
