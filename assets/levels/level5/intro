[CONNECTION ESTABLISHED]

“Hello?”

“Hi there, this is the engineer ship sent to repair your laser connection.”

“The laser? You want to fix it? Hmm… yes, that shouldn't come as a surprise. Of course they'd send someone over.”

“...is something wrong with that?”

“Wrong? Oh no, no… it's very natural to repair something that broke, in fact. What I don't understand is, why was it built to work this way in the first place?”

“Ah, finally someone who shares my confusion! Do you have any idea?”

“No, sadly not. Just that the circumstances behind their construction were rather… strange. We used to have a system where spaceships came by and dropped of enough fuel to satisfy our power needs for an entire month. I get that they wanted to cut down on pilot space ship costs, but isn't a laser that goes over such huge distances normally really ineffective at transmitting energy?”

“It should be, yes. I didn't expect it to go over more than four planets without getting recharged by a different power source.”

“The former Empire had some really clever engineers in their higher ranks. I guess they must have figured out some incredible new technology, since this laser won't be recharged along the way any time soon. But they didn't tell anyone how it works. I don't even know what the actual source of our energy is.”

“All I know is how to redirect the beam, and that is all I need to know for now.”

“Yes, of course. Please go ahead and do what you came for. We do need the energy after all.”

Right, I don't need to know more… but that doesn't mean I'm not interested. I should ask the people that hired me at the end of this job.
