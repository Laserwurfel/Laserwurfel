“Hello, planet Uuuujok here.”

“Hi, I'm here for your electricity.”

“You're going to fix it? Great! We can't store our sheep meat very long before it goes bad without electricity. This helps us a lot.”

“No problem. I have a small question, if you don't mind… is the fruit from the trees around here safe to eat?”

“The trees? I wouldn't go near them if I were you. They are very poisonous. One bite of their fruit and you die within a day. We try very hard to prevent our sheep from doing just that. Poor Janeha, from our neighbour planet, got infected by accident...”

“I am sorry. Why are your plants so deadly?”

“We originally didn't have any trees, actually. During the revolution, they were developed as a biological weapon.”

“A biological weapon?! Did the Empire want to kill its citizen that much?”

“Well, funny story, it was actually the Freedom Fighters that made them. Them striking the homes of us regular people was just a… casualty.”

“But biological weapons are designed for genocide, no matter how you look at it! They are no tool for revolutionists that are only trying to overthrow their government!”

“Keep your voice down! Look, mistakes happen during war. Please just do your job.”

“Huh? Ok...”

On who's side are these 'Freedom Fighters' anyway?
