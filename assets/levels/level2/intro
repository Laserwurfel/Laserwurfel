What an odd system. I wonder who came up with this. Anyway, on to the next planet.

[CONNECTION ESTABLISHED]

“Planet Ybdrozul here.”

“Hello, this is Joseph Feldstärke. I'm here to fix your energy supply.”

“Oh, just in time! Our emergency batteries were just about to go out.“

They have emergency batteries? So they aren't completely incompetent.

“We had already run out of AA batteries, and had to switch to the AAA ones.”

I take back what I said.

“Anyway, I'm sure you want to begin with your work. We tried doing it ourselves, so some nodes are already connected… but without a bird's perspective we couldn't coordinate very well. I hope our connections don't stand in your way!”

“Well, they certainly don't help… but don't worry, it should be no problem to find a way around them.”

“Thanks so much. Our worlds are so small, one would think with our village sized population we'd have enough time on our hands to try to learn how to connect these things correctly. But you know how the saying goes, 'A small dog doesn't learn any new tricks'.”

“I didn't know that one, actually. Where I come from it's an old dog, not a small one.”

“Really? Surprising how much things change over such small distances, just a few clusters away.”

“Not that surprising. Anyway, I'll contact you when I'm done.”
