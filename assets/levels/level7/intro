“You must be the engineer that was promised to us! Welcome to planet Jorbgorb.”

“I am. Say, could you tell me something about what happened here around 430 Jorbgorb yea- I mean one hundred Earth years ago?”

“You mean the great collapse? Alright, you seem to know nothing about our history, so let me give you a little lesson. 

It was a very violent event. We still don't know what exactly caused it. Space time was warped drastically, and before we knew it, our planets were destroyed and broken down into tiny rocks such as the one I am standing on right now.”

“That's terrible… How could there be survivors?”

“Very swift evacuation. But the majority of us died that day. The FZIRF is only a tiny fraction of what it used to be. Anyway, after the catastrophe, most of us were devastated and despaired. But then, a great Zarglzorbian emerged from the masses! He promised us a way to rebuild, and gave us a new hope. His engineers developed devices that could turn a chunk of rock into a habitable planet. One of them is inside the core of this planet too. 

Under his rule, all of us enjoyed for the first time a great feeling of unity, since before the collapse the Zarglzorbian region consisted of many different tribes and colonies, each with their own form of government. So we made him our king, and he created the great Zarglzorbian Empire. Meluem was his name. He was killed by the Freedom Fighters during the uprising.”

“So that's what happened… the Empire was much younger than I expected. But there is one thing I don't understand. Why was there a revolution against this Meluem, if he was such a great king?”

“Ehm… well, doesn't everyone want freedom? In the end he was still a dictator.”
