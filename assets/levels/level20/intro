[CONNECTION ESTABLISHED]

“Hello, my old friend.”

“...Xarvian again? Why are you on this planet?”

“Did you think I retired? No, I am still doing my job. And this is it. I must be here for the final connection. Soon, we will go full circle.”

“Final connection? You mean, the laser beam doesn't go any further than this planet?”

“Oh, it does! But still, this is the last station where your assistance is required. After that, we will take over, and you can rest.”

“...please, tell me. What am I doing here exactly? What will happen after this? I get the feeling there is a greater purpose behind this than just distributing energy and electricity.”

“Very well, after coming this far, you deserve to know. When you complete this final puzzle, which the Empire built in order to stop the new government... we win.”

…

“What if I don't do it?”

“Then I will. The difference is, if you do it, you get to live.”

“What's this? A whole fleet of space ships appeared! Hundreds of them! Is this… the Republic's military?”

“I hope you understand now the situation you are in. This is our entire military force, led by the highest government officials themselves.”

“But why? Why me? Why so many ships? What is going on?”

“We chose you because we thought a foreigner wouldn't meddle with our affairs. Not that it really mattered in the end. 

Now go. Finish what you started.”

It seems that I have no other choice…
