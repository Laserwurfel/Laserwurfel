Something seems off about all this… I know I am not in a position to stick my nose into other country's businesses. But it can't hurt to ask some questions, can it?

“Planet Whkharthistanistan here. We don't get many visitors, who are you?”

“My name is Joseph, and I was sent to fix your energy gri- I mean energy line.”

“Ah, yes yes, go ahead. Enjoy your stay in our tiny orbit.”

“Ehm… excuse me, but I've been wondering. Why are all the planets here so small? I don't mean to be rude, but where I come from, a rock this size would hardly qualify as a dwarf planet even.”

“You don't know? We used to live on much larger planets. But that changed at inter-universal space date 6295012.BHD{11<x<9}-Theta in Base Pi, around one hundred Earth years ago.”

“Wait… Earth years? Why would you use the revolution of a long dead planet around an even longer dead sun as a unit of time?”

“Doesn't all life originally come from there? We like to use this archaic unit because we have so many planets, all with different year lengths, that we must use an arbitrary value anyway. And we like to remind ourselves of our mysterious, ancient ancestors.”

“That's all speculation as far as I know. The only scientifically verifiable fact is, that every life form once developed on a single planet. But Earth is just one of many candidates for this.”

“In this region of space we traditionally believe in Earth. If you don't like it you can leave.”

Did I say something wrong? I hope my next stop is more helpful…
